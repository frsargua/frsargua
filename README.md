A Chemistry Graduate turned turned Full Stack Web Developer. Recently, graduated from the University of Birmingham's Full Stack Bootcamp.

I am a full stack developer with a logical mindset, who enjoys analysing and solving problems on a daily basis. Thanks to the experience I gained as tutor and in the service sector, I am confident explaing complex ideas and talking in public.

I am currently looking for an entry level/ junior position as a React Front-end developer.
